Following steps are to be executed on terminal in Raspberry Pi  or SSH console.

Determinig interface names
- From the command line, run 'ifconfig'.
- This will give you the usb interface name 'usb0' or similar and the ethernet interface 'eth0' or similar.

Install dnsmasq
- From the command line, run `sudo apt install dnsmasq` to install dnsmasq. 
- Stop it, for now, with `sudo systemctl stop dnsmasq`

Static IP for eth0
- Now set a static IP address for the ethernet connection (eth0). 
- Edit dhcpcd.conf with `sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf`. 
- Go to the end of the file and edit it so that it looks like the following:
***
interface eth0
    static ip_address=192.168.10.1/24
***

Configure dnsmasq

- Backup old conf file and create a new conf file:
***
sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.bkp
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
***
- Add these lines:
***
interface=eth0
dhcp-range=192.168.10.150,192.168.10.170,255.255.255.0,24h
***
- This will define a new DHCP range 192.168.10.x which will be given to any device connected to ethernet port of raspberry pi.
- Now start dnsmasq with `sudo systemctl start dnsmasq`

IP forwarding

- Edit sysctl.conf with `sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf` and uncomment this line.
***
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
***
Enable traffic forwarding with `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

- Add a masquerade for outbound traffic on usb0
***
sudo iptables -t nat -A  POSTROUTING -o usb0 -j MASQUERADE
***

- Save the iptables.
***
sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"
***

- Edit rc.local with `sudo nano /etc/rc.local`
- Add this just above "exit 0" to install these rules on boot.
***
iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat
***

- Restart Raspberry Pi
Execute command 'sudo init 6'
